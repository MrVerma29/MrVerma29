A BBA Decision Science student at Christ University (Industry Integrated), currently deep-diving & sharpening skills in the world of data analysis at MuSigma (APPRENTICE). 
By day, I'm honing my Python, EDA, SQL, Tableau, and Power BI skills, gaining invaluable hands-on experience with a hunger to become a Future Business Analyst. 
By night, hungry for business knowledge, you'll find me exploring innovative solutions and devouring information on all things business to make an impact with data insights.
