A BBA Decision Science student at Christ University (Industry Integrated), dedicated to mastering the art of data analysis. Currently, I drive insights and solutions as an apprentice at MuSigma, where I apply my skills in SQL, MySQL, Python, R, and Advanced Excel to tackle real-world data challenges.

At MuSigma, I craft complex queries, execute comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and automate data processes. I transform raw data into actionable insights using Tableau and Power BI, enabling teams to make data-driven decisions. My role constantly engages my critical thinking and problem-solving abilities, uncovering insights that drive business performance.

Academically, I have been honored with the Merit Scholarship at Christ University for my exceptional performance. Beyond academics, I lead the social media strategy as the Core Social Media Manager for MirAI, the AI and Analytics Committee, where I leverage data to enhance our digital presence and boost community engagement.

My passion lies in exploring innovative data solutions and delivering impactful insights. I am eager to embrace new challenges and contribute to data-driven strategies that shape business success.

Letâ€™s connect and collaborate on transforming data into meaningful actions!
